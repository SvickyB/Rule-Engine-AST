# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

This project implements a Rule Engine using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) concepts, allowing users to create, manage, and evaluate rules with flexible logical operators. Users can combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators and evaluate conditions to get true/false results.

## üöÄ Features

- **Rule Management**: Create, read, update, and delete rules
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate rules with provided input to get true/false results
- **Description-Based Rules**: Create rules in string format with descriptions for easy reference
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for managing and evaluating rules

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker/Podman

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
- Docker or Podman (for containerized setup)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SvickyB/Rule-Engine-with-AST.git
cd Rule-Engine-with-AST
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Replace .env file with following variables in the root directory
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=rule_engine
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Database Setup
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Create a database named 'rule_engine'
- The application will automatically create required tables on startup

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Without Docker

1. Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Access application at `http://localhost:5173`

### With Docker/Podman

1. Build containers:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. Run containers:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Creating a Rule
```json
{
  "rule": "amount > 1000",
  "description": "Check if amount exceeds 1000"
}
```

### Combining Rules
```json
{
  "rules": ["rule1", "rule2"],
  "operator": "AND",
  "description": "Check both conditions"
}
```

### Evaluating Rules
```json
{
  "ruleId": "rule1",
  "input": {
    "amount": 1500
  }
}
```
