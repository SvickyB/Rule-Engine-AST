# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

This project implements a Rule Engine using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) concepts, allowing users to create, manage, and evaluate rules with flexible logical operators. Users can combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators and evaluate conditions to get true/false results.

## üöÄ Features

- **Rule Management**: Create, read, update, and delete rules
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate rules with provided input to get true/false results
- **Description-Based Rules**: Create rules in string format with descriptions for easy reference
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for managing and evaluating rules

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (if using containerized setup)
  - Docker Engine (version 20.10.0 or higher)
  - Docker Compose (version 2.0.0 or higher)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites for Docker Setup
1. Ensure Docker is installed and running:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

2. If Docker is not installed:
   - For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose`
   - For MacOS: Install Docker Desktop from the official website
   - For Windows: Install Docker Desktop with WSL 2 backend

#### Running with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SvickyB/Rule-Engine-AST.git
cd Rule-Engine-AST

# Build and start containers
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`

#### Docker Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with Docker:
- Ensure Docker daemon is running: `sudo systemctl start docker`
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Verify port availability: Ensure ports 5173 and 3000 are not in use
- Check Docker permissions: Add your user to the docker group or use sudo

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Without Docker)

If Docker setup is not working or if you prefer a traditional setup:

1. **Backend Setup:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Replace .env file with following variables
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=your_db_port
```

2. **Database Setup:**
- Install PostgreSQL if not already installed:
  ```bash
  # For Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  
  # For MacOS using Homebrew
  brew install postgresql
  ```
- Start PostgreSQL service:
  ```bash
  # For Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo service postgresql start
  
  # For MacOS
  brew services start postgresql
  ```
- Create database:
  ```bash
  createdb rule_engine
  ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. **Running the Application:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Creating a Rule
```json
{
  "rule": "amount > 1000",
  "description": "Check if amount exceeds 1000"
}
```

### Combining Rules
```json
{
  "rules": ["rule1", "rule2"],
  "operator": "AND",
  "description": "Check both conditions"
}
```

### Evaluating Rules
```json
{
  "ruleId": "rule1",
  "input": {
    "amount": 1500
  }
}
```
